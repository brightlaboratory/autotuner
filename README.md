This repo contains an implementation of the Parallel Rank Ordering (PRO) algorithm as enunciated in the [Parallel Parameter Tuning for Applications with Performance Variability](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/4204647_Parallel_Parameter_Tuning_for_Applications_with_Performance_Variability) paper.

The PRO implementation is in C with C API. Additionally, the repo features a Python interface -- the PRO API may be invoked from Python code.
